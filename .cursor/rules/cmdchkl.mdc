- [ ] Python files use snake_case (e.g., `proton_model.py`)
- [ ] Classes use PascalCase (e.g., `ProtonModel`)
- [ ] Functions and methods use snake_case (e.g., `calculate_energy`)

## Usage

This checklist should be used:
1. Before committing code changes

4. When adding new commands
5. When modifying existing commands

Each item should be checked off as completed, and any issues should be addressed before the code is considered ready for production.
