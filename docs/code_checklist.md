## 1. Code Quality Checklist

### 1.1 File Structure and Organization
- [ ] File size does not exceed 350-400 lines
- [ ] One class per file (except exceptions, enums, errors)
- [ ] Large classes split into facade class and smaller components
- [ ] All imports at file beginning (except lazy loading)
- [ ] File header contains Author and email information

### 1.2 Naming Conventions
- [ ] Python files use snake_case (e.g., `proton_model.py`)
- [ ] Classes use PascalCase (e.g., `ProtonModel`)
- [ ] Functions and methods use snake_case (e.g., `calculate_energy`)
- [ ] Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `PROTON_MASS`)
- [ ] Private methods use leading underscore (e.g., `_validate_parameters`)

### 1.3 Documentation Standards
- [ ] All classes have docstrings in English
- [ ] All methods and functions have docstrings in English
- [ ] Docstrings follow Google/NumPy style
- [ ] Comments in code are in English
- [ ] User communication is in Russian
- [ ] Country references use Ukrainian symbols

### 1.4 Code Quality Tools
- [ ] Code formatted with black (line length 88)
- [ ] No flake8 errors or warnings
- [ ] No mypy type checking errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or configuration)
- [ ] No `pass` statements in production code (use `NotImplemented` for abstract methods)

## 2. Command Properties Checklist

- [ ] Command handles graceful shutdown

### 2.3 Parameter Validation
- [ ] All parameters have type hints
- [ ] All parameters have default values where appropriate

## Usage

This checklist should be used:
1. Before committing code changes
2. During code reviews
3. Before releasing new versions
4. When adding new commands
5. When modifying existing commands

Each item should be checked off as completed, and any issues should be addressed before the code is considered ready for production.
